Abstractâ€”In many systems, due to the lack of an adequate positioning
capability or the need for energy saving, it is infeasible to
track the location of a mobile device as it is moving. Its trajectory,
however, may be reconstructed from the real-time fingerprint
data that are obtained by the sensors built in the device. For
this purpose, we investigate a regularization framework aimed
to maximize the localization accuracy by taking into account
the spatiotemporal properties regarding the fingerprint space in
relation to the location space. The viability of this framework is
demonstrated in an evaluation using real-world datasets, which
shows its potential to outperform conventional approaches to
location fingerprinting.

Could not justify the energy saving condition, but no, you don't need
