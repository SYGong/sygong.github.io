The worst way to approach this task is to
treat it like the reading of a textbook—reading from title to literature cited, digesting
every word along the way without any reflection or criticism. Rather, you should begin
by skimming the article to identify its structure and features. 

Introductions serve two purposes: creating readers’ interest in the subject and providing
them with enough information to understand the article. 

Paragraph level: words or phrases to look for
• surprising
• unexpected
• in contrast with previous work
• has seldom been addressed
• we hypothesize that
• we propose
• we introduce
• we develop
• the data suggest

Reading is an active task. Before and during your reading, ask yourself these questions:
• Who are these authors? What journal is this? Might I question the credibility of
the work?
• Have I taken the time to understand all the terminology?
• Have I gone back to read an article or review that would help me understand this
work better?
• Am I spending too much time reading the less important parts of this article?
• Is there someone I can talk to about confusing parts of this article?

After reading, ask yourself these questions:
• What specific problem does this research address? Why is it important?
• Is the method used a good one? The best one?
• What are the specific findings? Am I able to summarize them in one or two
sentences?
• Are the findings supported by persuasive evidence?
• Is there an alternative interpretation of the data that the author did not address?
• How are the findings unique/new/unusual or supportive of other work in the field?
• How do these results relate to the work I’m interested in? To other work I’ve read
about?
• What are some of the specific applications of the ideas presented here? What are
some further experiments that would answer remaining questions?
