Location fingerprinting is a range-free approach
to GPS-free localization. Conventionally, the fingerprint
space is defined as a feature vector space where a
fingerprint is a vector of location-sensitive measurements
associated with a location. However, in practice, it is
hard to find a quality feature space that is robust to
device heterogeneity and environment and infrastructure
dynamics. This paper advocates a fundamentally different
model where a fingerprint is defined as a dissimilarity measurement
associated with a pair of locations and proposes
a localization approach based on geometric embedding.

Need to justify the quality feature space problem.
