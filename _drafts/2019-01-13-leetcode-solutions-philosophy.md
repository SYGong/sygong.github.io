## Introduction

Solving LeetCode problems is inevitable for someone who want to ace software interview. But I want to do a little bit more by posting my own solution and wish it can help not only myself but others. This post will discuss the way each post presented and reasons behind it.   

## Structure of each post

1. Links to problem and solutions (if any).
2. One solution with time complexity analysis.
3. Variants.

Focusing on one solution that is best of the best. Best variants are provided, with different trade-offs. 

I am doing all the research so you don't have to, and you have the best to go, you don't even need to choose different approaches because life is too short. 

## Principles
 
Best solution should be easy to explain, understand and implement in interview with great, if not the best, in performance. Following practices are fall into two categloies of principles: 

1. Readability (and maintainability)
   - Use Python instead of Java or C
   - Following [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), Style Guide for Python Code
   - Curated variable names and comments
   - Advanced techniques (abstraction, enclosure, resursion and etc.) 
2. Performence
   - Asymptotic (or, Big O) notation. 

Variants
   1. Improvements in performance
      - 
      - Better performance but may not worth efforts
      - Great performance but hard to implement in interview
      - Extra backgound knowledge 
   2. Alternative approach 
   3. Some cheating results
   4. Generalizaion
   5.
