## Synopsis
**[Localization](#localization-algorithm) with LED bulbs**. Each bulb **use [BFSK to broadcast](#broadcast)** its own postion to a receiver, distance from which to each bulb will be estimated by **[optical channel model](#optical-channel-model)**. 

## Optical channel model
Given RSS, estimate distance between a receiver's light sensor and the bulb.

**Note:** Overall RSS is estimated, given some components of RSS and the [broadcasted](#broadcast) duty cycle of PWM.

### Assumptions of model
- Lambertian radiation pattern.
- All bulbs facing downward.
- Light sensor facing squarely upward.

## Broadcast
Use BFSK for modulation to broadcast each LED bulb's
- position, and
- duty cycle of PWM.

### Mitigate collisions
Random channel hopping.

#### Channelization
Whole available spectrum is bounded by 
- minimum frequency to prevent human perceivable flickering, 
- minimum of LED bulbâ€™s On/Off speed, and
- response speed of the light sensor on the receiver.

## Localization algorithm
Let $$n$$ denotes number LED bulbs observed. Use
- Newton's method, when $$n = 3$$;
- LMS method, when $$n > 3$$.

## Evaluation

- Compared to LED based algorithms that locate receiver to
   - position of the light source with the highest RSS, or
   - weighted average of the locations of the observed bulbs, using their RSS as weights.

- Compared to Wi-Fi based systems in terms of
   - accuracy,
   - database usage, and
   - overhead.
