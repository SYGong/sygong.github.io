## Segments

### Space segment
Constellation of satellites transmitting radio signals to [users](#user-segment). 

### Control segment
Worldwide network of ground facilities that maintain health of the [satellites constellation](#space-segment).

### User segment
Users with GPS receivers, which has antenna to receive radio signals transmitted by the [satellites](#space-segment), and processor to calculate the location of users (receivers).

## Signals


## Position

$$c(t_r - t_1) = \sqrt{(x_r - x_1)^2 + (y_r - y_1)^2 + (z_r - z_1)^2}$$
$$c(t_r - t_2) = \sqrt{(x_r - x_2)^2 + (y_r - y_2)^2 + (z_r - z_2)^2}$$
$$c(t_r - t_3) = \sqrt{(x_r - x_3)^2 + (y_r - y_3)^2 + (z_r - z_3)^2}$$
