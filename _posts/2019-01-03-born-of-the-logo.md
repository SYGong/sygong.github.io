## Idea
Essentially it is a window through which you will see blue mountain and sky, something that is beautiful to share (like [Blue Hills](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Hills+Reservation/@42.215952,-71.0676048,15z/) through my window). The window frame separated by that mountain (probability density function of normal distribution) in havles with top half becomes `M` (for moving) and bottom half becomes a chinese character å±± (mountains, Chinese characters are pictographic). It is more saturated to echoing website title [Moving Mountains]({{ site.url }}). 

## Aftermath
Better to have one, even an ugly one, because it is so hard to tell the tab from other 40 or even more tabs without a logo (favicon). Two month ago, with some online tools I drew a logo very similar to the black-and-white logo in step 1 (further steps were in my mind but no proper tool by my hand). It is not beautiful but way better than nothing. I was happy to tell everyone in [Changelog-2018-12-03]({{ "siyuangong.com/2018/12/03/Changelog-2018-12-03/" | absolute_url }}).
