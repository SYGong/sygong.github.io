## Digest
Using visible LED lights for localization develop optical channel model to estimate distance, BFSK and channel hopping  

### Multilateration

### Optical channel model
Given RSS, estimate distance from revceiver to LED lights.

#### Assumptions
- Lambertian radiation pattern
- All LED lights facing downward.
- Light sensor facing squarely upward.

### BFSK for communication
Beaconing LED light bulb's position.

**Note:** Because of PWM, the duty cycle $$\alpha$$.
