## Synopsis
AOA capability of the nodes can be used
to derive position information. We propose a method for all
nodes to determine their orientation and position in an ad-hoc
network where only a fraction of the nodes have positioning
capabilities, under the assumption that each node has the
AOA capability.

**Note:** *radio map* are fingerprints with their locations.

## Training
puts real locations in a floor plan into a high dimension space by MDS , such that the geometrical distances between the points in the high dimension space reflect
their real walking distances. , MDS is used to create a high dimension space, in which fingerprints are represented by points,
and their mutual distances are preserved.In traditional approaches, fingerprints are geographically unrelated, losing
the possibility of building fingerprint space.

## Fingerprint

## Mapping
betweenness centrality to identify corridor fingerprints.

## Fingerprint matching
nearest neighbor algorithm
