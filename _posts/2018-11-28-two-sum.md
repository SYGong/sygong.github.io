## Solution in python3
```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        indices = {}   # number to index
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - v
            if complement in indices:
                return [indices[complement], i]
            indices[v] = i
```

## Variants

### Return numbers instead of their indices. 
Store just numbers, use `set` instead of `dict`.

### More than one pair
Make a collection of pairs. [sample](https://coderbyte.com/algorithm/two-sum-problem)
