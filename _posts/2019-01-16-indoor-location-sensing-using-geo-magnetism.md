## Digest
**[Positioning](#positioning) system** using **disturbances of the earth's magnetic field caused by structural steel elements** as **fingerprints** that are **spatially varying** but **temporally stable**.

### Positioning
Least RMS based Nearest Neighborhood.

**Note:** [Article](article_link) uses RMS a lot, however it does not calculate arithmetic mean of the squares (refer to Equation 1).
