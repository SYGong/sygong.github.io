## Synopsis
**[Positioning](#positioning) system** using **disturbances of the earth's magnetic field** caused by structural steel elements as **fingerprints** that are **spatially varying** but **temporally stable**.

## Positioning
Least RMS based Nearest Neighborhood for **fingerprint** matching.

**Note:** [Article](article_link) uses RMS a lot, however it does not calculate arithmetic mean of the squares (Equation 1).

## Storyline
[Article](article_link) has been organized as a story with 3 major acts:
- *The Observed Characteristics of Indoor Magnetic Fields* (3.1)
- *Initial Investigation for the System Design* (3.2)
- *System for Pedestrian Localization* (4)

Each one has its motivation, design (hardware, algorithm or experiment), and findings/result/evaluation that lead to next act.

Scenes like *stability over time* or *effect of moving objects* (4.2.2) making the story solid.

*[RMS]: Root Mean Square
*[CDF]: Cumulative Distribution Function
*[distance error]: distance between ground truth position and predicted position
