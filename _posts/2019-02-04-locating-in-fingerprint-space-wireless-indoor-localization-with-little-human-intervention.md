## Synopsis
Measures walking steps to construct the *radio map* of a floor plan, which is previously obtained only by site survey. Calibration of fingerprints is crowdsourced and automatic.

**Note:** *radio map* are fingerprints with their locations.

## Training
puts real locations in a floor plan into a high dimension space by MDS , such that the geometrical distances between the points in the high dimension space reflect
their real walking distances. , MDS is used to create a high dimension space, in which fingerprints are represented by points,
and their mutual distances are preserved.In traditional approaches, fingerprints are geographically unrelated, losing
the possibility of building fingerprint space.

## Fingerprint

## Mapping
betweenness centrality to identify corridor fingerprints.

## Fingerprint matching
nearest neighbor algorithm
