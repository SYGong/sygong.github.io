## Synopsis
Measures walking steps to construct the radio map of a floor plan, which is previously obtained only by site survey. Calibration of fingerprints is crowdsourced and automatic.
To locate and track users inside buildings, **collect or compute signal strength fingerprint** by combining **empirical measurements** and [**signal propagation modeling**](#propagation-model).
