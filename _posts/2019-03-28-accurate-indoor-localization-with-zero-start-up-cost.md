## Synopsis
Enables handheld devices to emulate large antenna arrays using a new formulation of SAR.

## 
during SAR computation, the source is at a far distance compared to the movement of the tablet


{::comment}
Past work on SAR requires measuring mechanically controlled device movement with millimeter precision, far beyond what commercial accelerometers can provide.
SAR requires subcentimeter
accuracy in the device position along its trajectory
