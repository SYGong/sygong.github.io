## Solution in Python3
```python
from collections import Counter
from bisect import bisect, bisect_left

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        triplets = []
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return triplets
        num_freq = Counter(nums)
        nums = sorted(num_freq)  # sorted unique numbers
        
        # Get rid of numbers that are too large/small
        # such that no other number able to complete
        nums = nums[bisect_left(nums, -2 * nums[-1]) :
                    bisect(nums, -2 * nums[0])]
        if len(nums) < 1:
            return triplets

        max_num = nums[-1]
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if num_freq[v] >= 2:
                complement =  -2 * v
                if complement in num_freq:
                    if complement != v or num_freq[v] >= 3:
                        triplets.append([v] * 2 + [complement])

            # When all 3 numbers are different
            if v < 0:  # only when v is smallest
                two_sum = -v

                # lower/up bound of the smaller of remaining two
                lb = bisect_left(nums, two_sum - max_num, i + 1)
                ub = bisect(nums, two_sum // 2, lb)
                       
                for u in nums[lb : ub]:
                    complement = two_sum - u
                    if complement in num_freq and u != complement:
                        triplets.append([v, u, complement])
        return triplets

## Variants

### Two pointers
```python

```

### Remove duplicated triplets
Handle duplication seperately, may make the program more readable. However, it may not worth the effort to compare triplets given the data structure we have by hand. It will also sacrifice runtime.
