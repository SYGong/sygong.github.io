## Synopsis
Indoor [localization][#localization] technique using RSSI in a ZigBee sensor network to estimates the distance between sensor nodes.  

## Localization
- Maximum likelihood
- MMSE

**Note:** [article][article_link]'s implicit assumption of normal distribution is not necessarily true.

## Distance
The RSSI $$p$$ in $$\mathit{dB}m$$ is formulated as a function of distance $$d$$:

$$\mathit{p} = \Alpha\ln{d} + \Beta$$.

**Note:** Not sure RSSI defined in IEEE 802.15.4 is in $$\mathit{dB}m$$.
