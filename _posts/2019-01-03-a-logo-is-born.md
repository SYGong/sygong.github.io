## Idea
Essentially it is a window through which you will see blue mountain (probability density function of normal distribution) and sky, something that is beautiful to share (like [Blue Hills](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Hills+Reservation/@42.215952,-71.0676048,15z/) through my window). The skyline extensively devide frame into halves with top half becomes M (for moving) and bottom half becomes a Chinese character å±± (mountains, Chinese characters are pictographic). The frame is more saturated to echoing website title [Moving Mountains]({{ site.url }}). 

## Takeaway
Better to have a logo, even an ugly one, because it is so hard to tell a tab from other 40 or even more tabs without a logo (favicon). Two month ago, with some online tools I drew a logo very similar to the black-and-white logo in step 1 (further steps were in my mind but no proper tool by my hand). It is not beautiful but much better than nothing.
