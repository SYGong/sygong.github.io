## Idea
Essentially it is a window through which you will see blue mountain (probability density function of normal distribution) and sky, something nice to share (like [Blue Hills](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Blue+Hills+Reservation/@42.215952,-71.0676048,15z/) through my window). The skyline extensively devide frame into halves with **M** (for moving) on the top of a pictographic Chinese character **å±±** (means mountains). Saturate frame to echoing website title [Moving Mountains]({{ site.url }}).
